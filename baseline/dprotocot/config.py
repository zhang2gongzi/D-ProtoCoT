"""
Central configuration for the D-ProtoCoT reimplementation.

Every value here is overridable from the command line (see run.py). Defaults
follow the paper: bert-base-uncased, lr=2e-5, batch=16, epochs=3, tau=0.07,
hierarchical chunking 400/50.

Data schema expected (flat jsonl, one path per line):
    {
      "raw_example": {"id": <str>, "question": <str>, "context": <str, optional>, "label": <int/str>},
      "cot":         <str>,        # full reasoning path text (steps separated by '\n')
      "gold_label":  <int/str>,    # gold answer / label of the QUESTION
      "is_correct":  <0/1 or bool> # whether THIS path's final answer matches gold
    }
Lines sharing raw_example.id belong to the same question (its K sampled paths).
