I'd be happy to help you with this problem! However, I noticed that the format you requested is a bit different from what you provided in the demonstrations. I'll adapt the format to match the one you used in the demonstrations.

Here's my attempt at solving the problem:

## Step 1: Calculate the annual increase
The annual increase in membership fees is $10.

## Step 2: Calculate the increase over 5 years
To find the total increase over 5 years, we multiply the annual increase by 5: $10 × 5 = $50.

## Step 3: Calculate the membership fee in the sixth year
We add the total increase to the initial membership fee: $80 + $50 = $130.

The final answer is: $\boxed{130}$ $$\square$$
Final Answer: $\boxed{130}$ $$\square$$
I'm glad I could help with the problem. If you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else, feel free to ask!",$\boxed{130}$ $$\square$$

10,"The Rotary Club is holding its annual fundraising Omelet Breakfast, with tickets sold in advance. The tickets come in different price levels, for young children, older children, adults, and seniors. This year they sold 53 small children tickets, 35 older children tickets, 75 adult tickets, and 37 senior tickets. To figure out how many eggs they need to buy, the club estimates that small children can eat a half omelet, older children can eat a whole omelet, adults will eat two omelets, and seniors will eat one and a half omelets. Just to be on the safe side, they get enough eggs to make 25 extra omelets. If they use 2 eggs for each omelet, how many eggs will they need to buy?","Step 1: Calculate the total number of omelets for small children: 53 × 0.5 = 26.5 omelets.
Step 2: Calculate the total number of omelets for older children: 35 × 1 = 35 omelets.
Step 3: Calculate the total number of omelets for adults: 75 × 2 = 150 omelets.
Step 4: Calculate the total number of omelets for seniors: 37 × 1.5 = 55.5 omelets.
Step 5: Calculate the total number of omelets: 26.5 + 35 + 150 + 55.5 = 267 omelets.
Step 6: Add extra omelets: 267 + 25 = 292 omelets.
Step 7: Calculate the total number of eggs needed: 292 omelets × 2 eggs/omelet = 584 eggs.
